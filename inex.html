        <p>Hello, I'm Esteban and I like fishing! Here are my two favorite fishing reels that I recently purchased. The first one is the "Squall 2" by Penn. This type of reel is used to start casting long distances.</p>

    <p>The second reel I use is called "Conflict 2" by Penn. This reel was made to help with long cast as well. I mainly got it because of how cool it looks. </p>
    <h3>Where I fish</h3>

    <p>This is South Padre Island Jetties. It's a 40 min drive to get there. Whenever my dad and I want to go fishing this is usually the spot we go to.</p>
